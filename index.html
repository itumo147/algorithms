Instructions

The length of the sentence (the number of characters).
The number of words in the sentence (assuming that the words are separated by a single space).
The number of vowels in the sentence.
You have to keep in mind that: 

Each character will be treated separately.
The last character is the point.
Use three variables as counters.


// Write your agorithm here

.1) function getSentenceLength(sentence: String):
    // Step 1: Initialize a variable to store the length
    sentence_length = 0
    
    // Step 2: Calculate the length of the sentence
    sentence_length = length(sentence)
    
    // Step 3: Return the length of the sentence
    return sentence_length

.2) function countWords(sentence: String):
    // Step 1: Split the sentence into words
    words = split(sentence, " ")
    
    // Step 2: Count the number of words
    word_count = length(words)
    
    // Step 3: Return the word count
    return word_count


.3) function analyzeSentence(sentence: String):
    // Step 1: Initialize variables
    sentence_length = 0
    word_count = 0
    vowel_count = 0
    vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'}

    // Step 2: Calculate the length of the sentence
    sentence_length = length(sentence)

    // Step 3: Calculate the number of words
    words = split(sentence, " ")
    word_count = length(words)

    // Step 4: Calculate the number of vowels
    for character in sentence:
        if character in vowels:
            vowel_count = vowel_count + 1

    // Return the results
    return (sentence_length, word_count, vowel_count)


Insertion Sort using JavaScript: Each time work only with the first i-1 element from of the array
Pick element arr[i] and insert it into sorted sequence in the array from 0 to i-1.


function insertionSort(arr) {
    const n = arr.length;
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        let current = arr[i];
        let j = i - 1;
        
        // Move elements of arr[0..i-1], that are greater than current,
        // to one position ahead of their current position
        while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > current) {
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
            j--;
        }
        
        // Insert the current element into the sorted sequence
        arr[j + 1] = current;
    }
    return arr;
}
